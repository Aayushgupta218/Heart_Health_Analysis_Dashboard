# 🫀 Heart Health Risk Analysis Dashboard

An interactive data visualization project built using *Power BI* to analyze factors affecting heart attack risks across various demographic and lifestyle variables. This dashboard helps uncover critical health trends to guide preventive interventions and personalized healthcare strategies.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes over *1,000 patient health records* sourced from Kaggle to investigate how variables like blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, weight, exercise, and smoking habits impact heart attack occurrences.

The goal was to use *data analysis + visualization* to identify at-risk groups and the strongest predictors of cardiovascular risk.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- *Power BI* – Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive visualizations  
- *SQL* – Data querying, filtering, and relationship building  
- *Power Query (M Language)* – Data transformation and cleaning  
- *Excel* – Preliminary data handling  
- *Kaggle Dataset* – Public heart health dataset

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- *Bar Charts & Histograms* – Heart attack distribution across blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol  
- *Donut Charts* – Weight category segmentation  
- *Line Graphs* – Cholesterol vs. exercise patterns  
- *Slicers* – Gender and heart attack status filters  
- *Stacked Charts* – Smoking impact, exercise frequency analysis  
- *Dynamic KPIs* – Count of at-risk individuals by metric

---

## 🔍 Core Insights

- Non-smokers exercising *≥2 hours/week* had a *35% lower heart attack risk*  
- High blood pressure (≥128 mmHg) and cholesterol (≥220 mg/dL) showed strong association with heart attack occurrence  
- Weight range *75–85 kg* combined with inactivity showed highest risk clusters  
- Demographic filters revealed varying health patterns across *gender, height, and age groups*

---

## 🎯 Outcome & Impact

This dashboard can assist healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers in:

- Detecting early risk factors  
- Personalizing patient care plans  
- Designing targeted awareness or prevention campaigns  
- Empowering public understanding of heart health

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle – Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- Size: ~1,000 records  
- Format: CSV  

---

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.  
2. Refresh data or connect to the source file via Power Query.  
3. Use slicers to filter by gender, heart attack status, or lifestyle habits.  
4. Hover over visualizations for interactive tooltips and insight drilling.

## 🧠 Future Work

- Integrate real-time clinical data or survey inputs  
- Add predictive ML models via Python scripting in Power BI  
- Extend demographic filters (e.g., age range)  
- Embed dashboard into a web application for broader access
